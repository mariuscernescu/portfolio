After finishing a class on Advanced CSS, SASS, BEM(Block element
modifier), and design architecture I was inspired to create a personal
website where I can apply all the new skills.</br></br>
I used FlexBox for aligning most elements on the website and created
all animations using @keyframes or transform and transition in order to
ensure the best performance on the page.</br></br>
The most important lesson I learned while coding this site was how little
you need to struggle when you truly understand how a certain
technology works.</br></br>
